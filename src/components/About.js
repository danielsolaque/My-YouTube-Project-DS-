            <p>Hi! My name is Daniel Solaque After several years of wanting to bring
        tangible solutions to society, I decided to take a leap into the
        profession that has been doing it best: software development. I am
        currently Software Engineer with experience in dynamic flow simulation
        for the oil and gas industry. I’m a dynamic and adaptive professional
        with an international engineering background (1+ years) who is currently
        attending Pursuit Program Fellowship while seeking opportunities in
        Software Engineering and Full Stack Development to diversify my
        engineering experience and contributions in tech areas.

            <p> Hi! My name is Anthony Taylor, I began a career in technology by
        obtaining a COMPTIA Network+ certification. This led me to become an
        associate at Geek Squad for three years. I eventually steered towards
        the installation Mobile Electronics in vehicles instead of applying
        technological concepts & programming languages with computers, which is
        what I really desired.I found the Pursuit Fellowship Organization and
        began my path to becoming a Javascript developer.</p>
